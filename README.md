# SyncScript Pro

**SyncScript Pro** (previously referred to as **Assistant Toolbox** on FCP Cafe) will be a Workflow Extension that spins out **Titles to Keywords** and **Auto Sequence** from CommandPost.

It'll include various improvements and enhancements to make the job even easier for Assistant Editors working on long-form feature film projects.

This project is currently at the exploration and experiment stage.

Here's what the Toolbox's currently look like in CommandPost:
